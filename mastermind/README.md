### MasterMind Game Project (WIP)
**(All pieces of software seen in this project are created and tested by Steven Salisbury. If any bugs are discovered, please contact me.)**

I have made a minesweeper program and worked on a rendering engine, so I thought it would be fun to remake another game I like in programming, MasterMind. Hopefully I can use machine learning in the future to play this game, but for now I just want to make it work.
